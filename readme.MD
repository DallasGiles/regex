**Regex Tutorial: Understanding Password Validation Pattern**
**Introduction**
In this tutorial, we will break down a specific regex pattern used to validate passwords. This pattern ensures that a password meets certain criteria, including:

	•	At least one uppercase letter
	•	At least one lowercase letter
	•	At least one digit
	•	At least one special character
	•	Minimum length of 8 characters

**REGEX Example**
^(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}$

**REGEX Breakdown**
1.	^: Start of the string.
	•	The ^ symbol asserts the position at the start of the string. It ensures that the regex pattern matches from the beginning of the input.
	2.	(?=.*[A-Z]): Ensure at least one uppercase letter.
	•	(?= ... ): This is a positive lookahead assertion. It checks for the presence of the specified pattern without consuming characters.
	•	.*: Matches any character (except newline) zero or more times.
	•	[A-Z]: Matches any uppercase letter from A to Z.
	•	Together, (?=.*[A-Z]) ensures that the string contains at least one uppercase letter.
	3.	(?=.*[a-z]): Ensure at least one lowercase letter.
	•	(?= ... ): Another positive lookahead assertion.
	•	.*: Matches any character (except newline) zero or more times.
	•	[a-z]: Matches any lowercase letter from a to z.
	•	Together, (?=.*[a-z]) ensures that the string contains at least one lowercase letter.
	4.	(?=.*\d): Ensure at least one digit.
	•	(?= ... ): Another positive lookahead assertion.
	•	.*: Matches any character (except newline) zero or more times.
	•	\d: Matches any digit from 0 to 9.
	•	Together, (?=.*\d) ensures that the string contains at least one digit.
	5.	(?=.[@$!%?&]): Ensure at least one special character.
	•	(?= ... ): Another positive lookahead assertion.
	•	.*: Matches any character (except newline) zero or more times.
	•	[@$!%*?&]: Matches any one of the special characters within the brackets.
	•	Together, (?=.*[@$!%*?&]) ensures that the string contains at least one special character from the set @$!%*?&.
	6.	[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,}: Define allowable characters and minimum length.
	•	[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]: Matches any uppercase letter, lowercase letter, digit, or special character within the brackets.
	•	{8,}: Ensures the string is at least 8 characters long.
	•	Together, [A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]{8,} allows the string to be composed of the specified characters and enforces a minimum length of 8 characters.
	7.	$: End of the string.
	•	The $ symbol asserts the position at the end of the string. It ensures that the regex pattern matches until the end of the input.
